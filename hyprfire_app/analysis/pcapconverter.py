"""
pcapconverter.py: converts packets from a pcap file into a list of PacketData objects
representing that file.
pcapConverter takes a filename (with extension) and calls editcapSplit, which uses editcap
(a command provided by Wireshark) to split the file into smaller files of 10000 packets each.
It then uses a pool of processes to run the extractData method on each of them concurrently.
extractData calls the Scapy library method PcapReader to obtain information about each packet and
convert it into a list of PacketData objects to be provided to packetdataConverter. The data from
each smaller file is compiled together and sorted, then returned.
